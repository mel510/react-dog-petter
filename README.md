# React Dog Petter
This React/Redux app iterates off the concept from https://github.com/mel510/sinatra-dog-petter. DogPetter is an app to track everyone's favorite activity: petting dogs. You can log your petting sessions by date, location, dog name, and dog breed, and "like" your favorite dogs.

## Installation & Usage

Clone this repo and in separate tabs: run `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed`, and `rails s -p 3001` for `dog-petter-api` and `npm install && start` for `dog-petter-client`.

## Roadmap
* User authentication
* Image uploading
* Date picker
* Google Maps API integration
* Deploy, so you don't have to run that pesky local server
* Pet more dogs

      <h1>How to Greet Dogs</h1>
      <p>There are two main rules when meeting new dogs: never pet a dog without owner permission, and always let the dog make first contact.</p>
      <p>After you receive permission from the dog&rsquo;s person, turn your body to the side and avoid making eye contact with the dog. Once the dog is comfortable and approaches you, let the dog sniff you to say hello. If the dog appears comfortable, slowly reach out to pet the dog on their chin or side of the body.</p>
      <p>Ask if you can take a photo then log your dog on DogPetter!</p>
